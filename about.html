        <p> Hi, everyone! </p>
            
        <p>This blog has been created to help spread the word about new (and not so new) awesome books! We created a bunch of categories for you to browse through and we are constantly working on new lists!</p>
        <p>We will post review of every book we read so it can help you later on! We love writing reviews and sharing amazing stories with others. We hope you enjoy it!</p>
            
            <p> Also there is a profile of each admin for you to see. Feel free to contact us about anything.
